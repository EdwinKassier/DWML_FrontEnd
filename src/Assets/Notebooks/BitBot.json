{"BitBot\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Goal of the BitBot notebook is to explore the use of RNN\n(specificially LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory) in a time series analysis\nproblem, and there is no better, or more diffiuclt, time series problem\nthan trading options. The reason for using LSTM is that the structure of\nthe RNN is such that it has feedback connections in its structure that\nallows for not only point predictions but allows predictions to be made\nkeeping a series of data in mind\n\n    from IPython.display import Image\n    Image(url": null}
